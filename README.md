# Creating a MEHN App for Daily Task Management

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of building a MEHN app — an acronym for MongoDB, Express, HTML, and Node.js — that allows users to manage, update, and edit their daily tasks. This app will provide a user-friendly interface for adding, modifying, and removing tasks to help users stay organized and productive.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing task data efficiently.
- **Express**: A backend framework for creating APIs and handling server-side logic.
- **HTML**: For building the user interface and rendering tasks.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.

## Project Setup

1. **Database Setup**: Install MongoDB and set up a database to store task information. Create a collection to hold task documents with fields like `name`, `completed`, and `_id`.

2. **Node.js Setup**: Initialize your Node.js project using npm or yarn. Install the necessary dependencies like Express and any other packages you might need.

3. **Express Server**: Set up an Express server to handle API routes. Define routes for getting, adding, updating, and deleting tasks.

4. **HTML Templates**: Create HTML templates to display tasks. You can use templating engines like EJS or Pug to dynamically render tasks fetched from the server.

## Building Functionality

### 1. Displaying Tasks

When the user visits the app, they should see a list of their daily tasks. Fetch tasks from the server using an API endpoint, and display them in the HTML template. You can add styling to differentiate completed tasks from active ones.

### 2. Adding Tasks

Provide a form where users can enter new tasks. Upon submission, use the Fetch API to send a POST request to the server with the new task details. After a successful response, refresh the task list to reflect the addition.

### 3. Updating Tasks

Each task should have an option to mark it as completed or active. Implement this using checkboxes. When a user checks or unchecks a task, send a PATCH request to update the task's `completed` status on the server.

### 4. Editing Tasks

Allow users to edit task names. Implement an edit button next to each task. When clicked, display a form with the task's current name pre-filled. Upon submission, send a PATCH request to update the task name.

### 5. Deleting Tasks

For each task, include a delete button. When clicked, send a DELETE request to the server with the task's ID to remove it from the database. Update the task list to reflect the deletion.

## Conclusion

By following this tutorial, you've created a MEHN app that provides users with the ability to manage, update, and edit their daily tasks. This app demonstrates the power of MongoDB for data storage, Express for API handling, HTML for user interaction, and Node.js for backend execution. You can further enhance the app with features like user authentication, due dates, and prioritization to make it a comprehensive task management solution.
